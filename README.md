# OIBSIP_TASKNO.2
It is a Number Guessing Game.
This task of my internship under Oasis Infobyte includes some major points which is mentioned below:-

1. You can only guess number between 1 to 100.

2. If you type the number which is less than the actual number generated by the system then it will return you an output "Your number is lesser than MyNumber."

3. If you type the number which is greater than the actual number generated by the system then it will return you an output "Your number is greater than MyNumber."

4. If you type the number which is greater than 100 then it will return you an output "Your number is out of the guessing options. Please try a number between 1 to 100"

5. If you type the number which is correct and equal to the actual number generated by the system then it will return you an output "You won!!! Your number is correct. MyNumber was ____"

6. To exit the game you just have to type -1 in your guessing number and then the system will return you an output "You exit the game. My number was ___"
